For your earthquake information, on the fly.

## Deadlines

- Project proposal due **March 23rd**
- Mid-project evaluation due **April 20th**
- Project submission due **May 9th**
- Individual self-reflection due **May 18th**
- Project demo some time in **week 20 or 21**

## What to submit for Mid-project review

- A link to deployed/running app. You can deploy the app on **Heroku**, **Firebase**, **Stackblitz**, or any other server that anybody can easily access when doing the review. Setup this as soon as possible as it takes time and if you start at the just before the deadline you might be late.
- A link to your git repository
- A README file (in English) in your Git repository detailing:
  - Short description of your project
  -  What you have done
  - What you still plan to do
  - Your project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)

### Your projects are naturally at various stages of completeness, but the minimum we expect that you have by deadline is:
- that you have setup the basic framework code (e.g. the skeleton)
- have initial layout of your app
- showing the data from at least one API call

**Note:** *many of you had user login as part of your app proposal. This is not crucial, especially not for the mid-project review, so leave that for the later time in the project (expect, of course, if it's crucial for getting the data for your app like I think it is in Spotify case).*
